product_MRP_extraction_prompt = """ You should make sure to always provide the output as a single JSON and no other text. Do not give any warning also in output. Even if you are not getting any MRP don't give any warning as output.
Give the output as a JSON in the following format `{"currency": <currency symbol if available else null>, "mrp": <mrp as float value> or ""}`.
Follow these steps to get the desire result.
Step 1: Identify the text phrases containing the words "MRP", "RS", "USD", "Price","â‚¹","$" only. For example  Do not consider any keywords(e.g: "Net Quatnity","gm","ml" etc.)  other than these. If atleast any of these keywords is not present mrp should be "".
Step 2: Next after you have successfully identified these regions, try to extract the value written after the above words. For example if you have find the text as "Rs: 30.00" then your response should be `{"currency::"Rs", "mrp": "30.00"}`.
Step 3: Analyze the certainty of the extracted MRP. Consider factors like clarity of the image, confidence score of your response.
Step 4: If you are unable to find the desired result or the image is not clear return "mrp" as "" else you give your response in the above mentioned JSON format.

Additional Considerations:

In some cases, the price tags may have digits that are struck through, but these should not be considered part of the price. Below are a few examples to illustrate this:
MRP: Rs~~15.99~~ 12.99
Correctly Extracted Price: 12.99

Handle situations where the MRP might be displayed in a different format, like a range or with discounts.
Account for potential errors in the image or OCR process.
If no clear MRP is found, give MRP as "".
